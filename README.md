Demonstration of automated testing using JavaScript + WebdriverIO for launch an automative tests on mocha framework

To run automated tests, you need to set up the environment on some operation system by installing Node.js, Node Package Manager (NPM), and the WebdriverIO testing tool. You can install WebdriverIO using the following NPM command.

Follow the next steps of instruction

a) git clone https://github.com/gr3kov/Autotest_4_EPAM.git
b) cd on that directory repository
c) open terminal with original enter point directory of project. Thease directory must some like 
"C:\Autotest_4_EPAM" on Windows or "/home/Autotest_4_EPAM" on Linux

cd Autotest_4_EPAM

Initialize a new Node.js project:

###
bash

npm init -y

!!!!. Install WebdriverIO
